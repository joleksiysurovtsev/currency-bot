This project is a telegram bot written on Spring Boot and Kotlin. At the moment the bot is able to provide information
about the current exchange rate of currencies, but in the future the functionality will be expanded.

To interact with the bot, open Telegram and find your bot by the name you specified in the configuration. Start chat with a bot and use the commands:

- `/start` - Get a welcome message.
- `/get_exchange_rate` - Get the current exchange rate.
